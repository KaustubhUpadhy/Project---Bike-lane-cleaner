Move the images and test videos to a seperate folder and load it from there
Seperate files for object detection(suersonic sensors or integrate it with the camera), traffic lights detection (Lidar sensor maybe)
Will also have to think of a way to make the program work with the detection of only one edge as we are dealing with the bake lane.(maybe work with gutter as edges)

Add perspective transform 
Also add for robot to move with lane following
For now just work on adding an input for video intake. The next part would be replacing the sample video with a video that uses bike lane and then change the values accordingly.
Test with online footage first. 
Try automating the process of finding the region of interest. or finalize the particular values.
Try the different approach as well.
